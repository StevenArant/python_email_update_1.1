# python_email_update_1.1
First coding project from scratch, it filters through emails and changes domains to match a new one if needed.

The purpose of this script is to check, change, and update emails with a newly supplied domain, as if you were changing servers for an organization.
The data is supplied manually, and not through a library yet. This is a change to come later.
